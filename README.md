## 💡 Description

This project is built around an AI agent that interacts with humans, receives natural language feedback, analyzes sentiment, and learns to optimize responses to maximize positive human emotion — **Joy**.

### Features:
- Interactive text-based interface
- Sentiment analysis on user feedback
- Reward shaping based on emotional response
- Model training loop for happiness optimization

## 🚀 How to Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run interaction interface:

```bash
python src/interface/cli.py
```

Train the model:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

## 🧠 Future Work

- Integrate large language model (e.g., GPT, Mistral)
- Human-AI co-creative conversation generation
- Visual dashboard for emotional analytics
